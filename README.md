# Verilog code of multiplier
 Implementing multipler using fsm on verilog

 ## Let's breakdown the code
 ### Module Declaration:
 This declares a module named multiplier with four inputs: rst (reset signal), clk (clock signal), A (16-bit input), and B (16-bit input), and one output Y (16-bit output).
 
 ### Internal Signals:
 P: 16-bit register storing the partial product.
 b: 16-bit register storing the value of B.
 state: 2-bit register representing the current state of the state machine.
 next_state: 2-bit register representing the next state of the state machine.
 parameter: Declares four parameters for state encoding.

 ### State Machine Logic:
 This block updates the current state based on the clock signal. If rst is asserted, the state machine is reset to the idle state; otherwise, it transitions to the next state.

 ### Control Signal Generation:
 This code generates a control signal BNEZ which is high when b is not equal to zero.

 ### State Transition Logic:
 This block determines the next state based on the current state and the control signal BNEZ.

 ### State Action Logic:
 This block performs actions based on the current state:

 When in the idle state, P is reset to zero, and b is initialized with the value of B.
 When in state S1, P is incremented by A, and b is decremented by 1.
 In other states, P and b remain unchanged.

 ### Output Assignment:
 This assigns the value of P to the output Y.

 ### End of Module:
 Marks the end of the module definition.
